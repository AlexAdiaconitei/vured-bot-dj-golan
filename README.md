# Configuration
In order to get the Bot working on your Discord Server you need to manually invite it using the URL generator that you can find on the Discord Developer Portal.

Minimum permissions required code: 2150640640

You can deploy the BOT on your custom VPS using Docker or you can choose a serverless platform. More info on the [self-hosted](#Its-self-hosted) section.

### Environment variables
These are the Environment variables needed to get your Bot working.
- `BOT__TOKEN`: Your Discord Bot token. It can be acquired in the 'Bot' section after creating a 'New Application'. (Create your Discord App here  [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications))
- `BOT__MAX_PLAYLIST_TRACKS`: Maximum amount of tracks accepted in the queue. (Default: 100)

The following ID's can be obtained by enabling the "Developer Mode" on Discord. More info [here](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-)
- `DISCORD__ACCESS_ROLE`: The ID of the Role that will have permission to execute commands and queries on the bot.
- `DISCORD__GUILD`: The ID of the Discord Server where the bot will be installed.
- `DISCORD__LOG_CHANNEL`: The ID of the text channel assigned for the bot's logs. (It is recommended to have a separate text channel for this where only moderators can view logs. For example: "vured-bot-logs")
- `DISCORD__MUSIC_CHANNEL`: The ID of the text channel where the BOT will stick its static message with the control buttons. This channel will also be listening for your URL inputs of tracks. <br>
  ‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT‚ö†Ô∏èThe bot will delete all messages on this channel if it contains any. It is recommended that you create a new channel for this. For example: "vured-bot"


Spotify Environment variables are optional. Only required if you wish to use Spotify features. To get a Spotify clientId & clientSecret you must go [here](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) and create a new application:
- `SPOTIFY__CLIENT_ID`: Your Spotify clientId.
- `SPOTIFY__CLIENT_SECRET`: Your Spotify clientSecret.
- `SPOTIFY__COUNTRY_CODE`: The country code you want to use for filtering the artists top tracks.

# It's self-hosted

Here are some services to deploy it.
